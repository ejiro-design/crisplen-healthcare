            <h3>Who are Crisplen Healthcare Recruitment?</h3>
            <hr>
            <p> We are an agency that provides healthcare professionals across a wide range of care settings such as
                care homes, supported living homes, hospitals, mental facilities and domestic staff. We understand the
                need to provide Health and Social Care facilities with competent, diligent and dedicated staff who are
                willing to deliver safe, effective and quality care to our clients. <br> We pride ourselves with the
                provision of skilled and experienced health care professionals to our clients.
                We individually interview our staff to make sure we pick the best skills, we ensure that our staff have
                enhanced DBS, appropriate covid pass and required training.

            <h4>Our Approach</h4>
            <hr>
            <p>For many of us, the question of care at home doesn’t arise until, suddenly, there is a need. At
                Bluebird
                Care Portsmouth, we strongly believe that prevention is better than cure. Most of us think that the
                stark choice is between either living self-sufficiently (without help), or being forced to ‘go into
                a home. Crisplen Portsmouth stops all that.</p>
