            <h3>Who are Crisplen Healthcare Recruitment?</h3>

            <h3>Our Approach</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>For many of us, the question of care at home doesn’t arise until, suddenly, there is a need. At
                Bluebird
                Care Portsmouth, we strongly believe that prevention is better than cure. Most of us think that the
                stark choice is between either living self-sufficiently (without help), or being forced to ‘go into
                a home. Crisplen Portsmouth stops all that.</p>
