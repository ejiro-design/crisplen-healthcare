            <h2>Who are Crisplen Healthcare Recruitment?</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>We offer adults of all ages the expert care and support they need to live independently at home.
            </p>
            <p>We’ll work with you and your family to establish your needs and preferences, creating a bespoke care
                package that’s completely unique to you, from occasional visiting care to 24-hour live-in care.</p>

            <h3>Our Approach</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>For many of us, the question of care at home doesn’t arise until, suddenly, there is a need. At
                Bluebird
                Care Portsmouth, we strongly believe that prevention is better than cure. Most of us think that the
                stark choice is between either living self-sufficiently (without help), or being forced to ‘go into
                a home. Crisplen Portsmouth stops all that.</p>

            <h4>Our value</h4>
            <hr>
            <p>From the first day we opened our business to serve our community, our customers have been at the
                heart of
                everything we do. Our team at Bluebird Care Portsmouth aims to deliver a home care service that we
                would
                be happy for our family and loved ones to receive.</p>

            <h5>The process</h5>
            <hr>
            <p>At Crisplen Portsmouth, we understand that life can be can complicated at the best of times. That’s
                why

                After the initial contact, we’ll liaise with you to find the best time to visit you, and will work

                budget.
